# Convex bodies

Until now, we wrote a very basic impulse based rigid body simulation. However, you probably noticed that it’s lacking a lot of features. The most noticeable is that it only checked collisions with spherical bodies.

In this lesson, we’re going to address this issue. The first few paragraphs will be about developing the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm. Which is an elegant and effective algorithm for detecting collisions between convex shapes. Then we’ll discuss how the algorithm can be extended for continuous collision detection with conservative advance.

Also, I want to go ahead and define the term simplex here. A simplex is the simplest geometric shape that can be formed from n+1 points, where n is the number of dimensions. So, in zero dimensions, the simplex is a point. In one dimension, the simplex is a line segment. In two dimensions, it’s a triangle. And in three dimensions it’s a tetrahedron.

## Shapes

### Shape class revisited

There’s a handful of functions that we’ll need to add to the base shape class in order to extend our collision detection to general convex shapes.

```
class Shape
{
public:
	enum class ShapeType
	{
		SHAPE_SPHERE,
		SHAPE_BOX,
		SHAPE_CONVEX
	};
	...
	virtual void Build(const Vec3* pts, const int num) {}
	virtual Vec3 Support(const Vec3& dir, const Vec3& pos, const Quat& orient, const float bias) = 0;
	virtual float FastestLinearSpeed(const Vec3& angularVelocity, const Vec3& dir) const { return 0; }

protected:
	Vec3 centerOfMass;
};
```

Notice that we’re only overriding the Support function. That’s because the support function gives us a point on the convex shape that is furthest in a particular direction. While the FastestLinearSpeed is a function that is only useful for non-spherical shapes. The FastestLinearSpeed function is used for continuous collision detection. It’s necessary for objects that are ”long”. Since a ”long” object that’s rotating might hit other objects, even though its linear velocity is zero. And for spheres, we don’t care how quickly they rotate; we only care about their linear velocity. But we’ll get more into this when we cover conservative advance later. So, let’s have a look at the Support function for spheres:

```
Vec3 ShapeSphere::Support(const Vec3& dir, const Vec3& pos, const Quat& orient, const float bias)
{
	return pos + dir * (radius + bias);
}
```

The dir vector is assumed to be normalized. Also, take note of the bias term. This is used to expand or shrink the apparent size of the shape. Which is necessary for accurately calculating the contact normal. But, we’ll discuss it more in a few paragraphs from now.

### Box shape

The first new shape we’re going to implement is the box shape. Boxes are so common in games, there’s a  joke of ”speed to crate” in a game. Most games will have some sort of obvious box/crate within the first  minutes of the game, and then there’ll be boxes littered throughout the rest. Therefore we really need to  know how to simulate them. It’ll also help ease us into general convex hulls.

We can think of boxes as oriented bounds, or we can think of boxes as convex hulls that have eight points  defining the corners. We are going to think of them as the latter, since that’ll be a natural way of moving  into general convex hulls.

And without further ado, the class declaration is:

```
class ShapeBox : public Shape
{
public:
	ShapeBox(const Vec3* points, const int num)
	{
		Build(points, num);

	}

	ShapeType GetType() const override { return ShapeType::SHAPE_BOX; }
	Mat3 InertiaTensor() const override;
	Bounds GetBounds(const Vec3& pos, const Quat& orient) const override;
	Bounds GetBounds() const override;
	void Build(const Vec3* pts, const int num) override;
	Vec3 Support(const Vec3& dir, const Vec3& pos, const Quat& orient, const float bias) override;
	float FastestLinearSpeed(const Vec3& angularVelocity, const Vec3& dir) const override;

	std::vector<Vec3> points;
	Bounds bounds;
};
```
Let’s first have a look at the Build function. This will be where we build the bounds and store the points  of the box:

```
void ShapeBox::Build(const Vec3* pts, const int num)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i)
	{
		bounds.Expand(points[i]);
	}

	points.clear();
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.mins.x, bounds.mins.y, bounds.mins.z });
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.maxs .x, bounds.mins.y, bounds.mins.z });
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.mins.x, bounds.maxs.y, bounds.mins.z });
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.mins.x, bounds.mins.y, bounds.maxs.z });

	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.maxs.x, bounds.maxs.y, bounds.maxs.z });
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.mins.x, bounds.maxs.y, bounds.maxs.z });
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.maxs.x, bounds.mins.y, bounds.maxs.z });
	points.push_back(Vec3{ bounds.maxs.x, bounds.maxs.y, bounds.mins.z });

	centerOfMass = (bounds.maxs + bounds.mins) * 0.5f;
}
```

The inertia tensor for a box is defined as:

\[ I =
\begin{pmatrix}
1/12 M(h^2 + d^2) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1/12 M(w^2 + d^2) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1/12 M(h^2 + w^2)
\end{pmatrix}
\]

With h, d, and w the height, depth and width of the box.

However, we can’t gaurantee that the box will be centered about the origin. In order to handle  them we need to take advantage of the parallel axis theorem. Recall the definition of the inertia tensor is:
